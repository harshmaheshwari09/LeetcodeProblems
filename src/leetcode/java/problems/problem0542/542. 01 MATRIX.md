# 542. 01 MATRIX

* Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix
* Solution: [here](Solution.java)
* Tags: #bfs
* Complexity: Time: O(m * n), Space: O(m * n)

## Problem Description

Given a matrix consisting of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents an empty cell and 1 represents a wall, you need to find the
distance of the nearest 0 for each cell. The distance between two adjacent cells is defined as 1. Return the matrix
after updating every cell with its nearest 0 distance.

the [LeetCode problem description.](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix)

## Solution
The solution to this problem involves using `breadth-first search (BFS)` to compute the distances of each cell from the
nearest 0. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Start by adding all the cells with a value of 0 to a queue.
2. While the queue is not empty, perform the following:
   * Pop a cell from the queue.
   * Compute the value for its neighboring cells. If it is able to update the neighbor, add that neighbor to the queue.
3. Return the matrix after updating every cell with its nearest 0 distance.

## Complexity Analysis
The `time complexity of this solution is O(m * n)`, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the
matrix. This is because in the worst case, we may have to visit every cell in the matrix. `The space complexity is O(m *
n)` as well, considering the space required for the queue.

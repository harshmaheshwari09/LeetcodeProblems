# 684. REDUNDANT CONNECTION

* Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection

* Complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

## Problem Description

In a given undirected graph, an edge connects two nodes and is considered redundant if it is already in the graph and
there is a path between the two nodes that does not include the edge. You need to find and return the redundant
connection in the form of an edge represented by two integers.

## Solution

The solution to this problem involves using the Union-Find algorithm to identify the redundant connection. The algorithm
follows these steps:

1. Initialize an array `parent` to represent each node's parent. Initially, each node is its own parent.
2. Iterate through each edge in the given graph:
    * Find the parent of the source node and the parent of the destination node using the `find` operation.
    * If the parents are the same, it means there is already a path between the two nodes. In this case, the current
      edge is redundant and can be returned as the answer.
    * Otherwise, perform the `union` operation to merge the two sets and update the parent accordingly.
3. If there are no redundant connections, return an empty array.

To better understand the Union-Find algorithm, it is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements
partitioned into several disjoint sets. It supports two main operations:

* `find(x)`: Find the parent (representative) of the set that element x belongs to. This operation is used to determine
which set an element belongs to.
* `union(x, y)`: Merge the sets containing elements x and y into a single set. This operation is used to combine two sets
into one.
The solution for this problem is implemented in the appropriate file [here](Solution.java)

## Complexity Analysis
The `time complexity of this solution is O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we iterate
through all the edges once and perform the Union-Find operations, which have nearly constant time complexity. The `space
complexity is O(n)` as well, considering the space required to store the parent array.
